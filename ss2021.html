       New trend alert! These colorful beaded necklaces with pearls are the latest hot item, as spotted on your favorite influencers like Victoria Paris. Celebs Gigi Hadid and Dua Lipa are also rocking this trend, and we know your Pinterest board shamelessly revolves around these necklaces. So how will you achieve the colorful look this summer?

        Fast fashion brands such as H&M have already caught onto the trend, but don't be tempted to buy here. As you know, we think purchasing from fast fashion brands is ok, as long as the items you are buying are good quality, time-less, and will live in your wardrobe for a while. Because these beaded necklaces are a micro trend, think about buying from somewhere that is more ethically sourced, thrift them, or make them yourself.

       Don't be afraid to go through the children's jewelry section at your local thrift shop, you might be able to find some cool and unique looking beads. In the women's jewelry, you might find the right pearls to pair the beads with. Make this a fun DIY activity and craft your own necklaces using the jewelry you found!

        If you're not into the DIY or thrift, and are willing to pay extra, small brands are the way to go. We recommend Martha Calvo Joolz, or Cara O Sello.
